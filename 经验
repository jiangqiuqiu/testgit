Git推送遇到 Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do

hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing 
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes 
hint: (e.g., ‘git pull …’) before pushing again.

原因：新推送的的分支与项目分支没有进行关联。 
解决方案; 
在项目根目录中右键选择“Git Bash Here”进入Git命令终端： 
输入：git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> master 
回车。 

然后再次推送就可以了。
git pull
